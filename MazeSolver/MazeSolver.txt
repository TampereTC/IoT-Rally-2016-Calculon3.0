Please find attached the file called maze_solver.ino. The strategy was a naïve one:
-          Drive straight

-          If a wall is detected then stop, reverse a bit and turn right

-          repeat

The ‘drive_straight’ sub-routine is incomplete as the steering for driving off the straight line (delta measured by variable ‘orientation’) is missing 
(Ref: lines 87 and 90) and was to be completed next.
