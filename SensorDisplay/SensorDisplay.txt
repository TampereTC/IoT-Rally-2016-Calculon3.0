Here is the web page I worked on during the first day before I got locked out from my computer.

It was intended to display some sensor data from the device. The displayed data was to be decided later on.

It displays and draws a line chart from randomized numbers with Smoothie.js
(which is expected to be found at "node_modules/smoothie/smoothie.js‚Äù in the same directory).
