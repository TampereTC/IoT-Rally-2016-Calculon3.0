Project code is for IoT Rally 2016 held on March 10.-11. 2016

Team members:

   Vik, Roland, Miika, Esa 

Since all participants were beginners in HW related projects there is no working result. Thus, in terms of a real-world project this would be marked as failed. However, the main purpose to learn and get into touch with something totally new was achieved.

Content

  - Gyro code (INO, example output etc.)

  - INO and Python code for reading the Gyro movements and stearing the motor
